"""Reject host-specific data and local identities from tracked public artifacts.

Identifiers are derived in memory from the current account, home, checkout and
host. Findings report only ``file:line`` and a category; the sensitive matched
value is never written or printed. Machine paths and persisted path fields are
checked independently, so the gate remains useful in clean CI environments.

Ported verbatim from agent-utilities' ``scripts/check_tracked_privacy.py``
(guardrail-tracked-privacy), which already passes green on agent-utilities'
own ``main`` -- reused rather than reinvented per this fleet's
Extend-Before-Invent convention (near-duplicate gate helpers have drifted
apart before; see MEMORY ``gate-tool-published-before-gate-adopted``). The
ONLY behavioral change from the agent-utilities original is
``_is_runtime_source_path`` below, which no longer gates on
agent-utilities' OWN top-level directory allowlist (``agent_utilities``,
``deploy``, ``docker``, ...) -- that allowlist is specific to that repo's
tree shape, and porting it unmodified into a repo with a different tree
(e.g. this repo's own top-level source directories) would silently scan an
EMPTY universe for every directory not on the borrowed list: a confident
green verdict over zero files, the exact "gates that report more coverage
than they have" failure this fleet has hit before. See that function's own
docstring for the replacement rule.

# convention -- while every enum-attribute access in this codebase is
# UPPER_SNAKE_CASE by convention, so requiring an exact-case lowercase

    D-ORC-57: purely ambient derivation (OS username, hostname, the CALLING
    process's local git config) makes the verdict depend on who/where the
    scan runs, not on the tree being scanned -- the same tree can PASS
    standalone and FAIL under pre-commit for no reason other than the two
    invocations seeing different ambient identities. Observed live: a lane's
    throwaway sandbox had ``git config user.name`` set to "Guard Test" (an
    isolated test identity, unrelated to this repository), and "guard test"
    then substring-matched the unrelated phrase "architecture guard test"
    already present in a tracked comment -- 279 manufactured false leaks from
    one ambient identity accident.

    ``AGENT_UTILITIES_PRIVACY_IDENTIFIERS`` is a DECLARED, stable override:
    when set (comma- or newline-separated), it is used INSTEAD of the
    ambient OS/git-config-derived candidates below, so CI/pre-commit can pin
    one deterministic identity set regardless of which sandbox or host runs
    the scan. Unset, behaviour is unchanged from before this fix -- additive
    only, so a caller that has not opted in loses no coverage (the real
    absolute-homelab-path leak D-GDI-1 caught stays caught either way; that
    detector is independent of this identifier set).

    ``git log -1 --format=%an%n%ae`` (HEAD's own committer identity) is
    deliberately NOT one of the candidate sources below -- it was removed
    2026-08-17 after it produced a ~450-line-across-~180-file false-positive
    flood, the same D-ORC-57 shape (a wrong ambient value substring-matching
    ordinary prose) but from a different source. ``git config user.name``/
    ``user.email`` capture the CALLING PROCESS's own stable, deliberately-set
    identity -- what this docstring means by "the current account". HEAD's
    last-commit author is not that: it is whichever identity committed most
    recently, which in this repo's own multi-agent-authored history rotates
    per commit and is, at the moment this was fixed, literally the single
    word "claude" (``git log -1 --format=%an`` on `main`) -- an ordinary,
    extremely common word in a Claude-focused agent-framework codebase, so
    every doc/comment/design-note that so much as names the tool became a
    manufactured leak. Unlike the "Guard Test" incident, adding it to
    ``_GENERIC_IDENTIFIERS`` would not fix this class -- the next commit's
    author could just as easily be "codex", "sonnet", "opus", or any other
    tool/model name, each requiring its own reactive exclusion. ``git
    config``'s two sources remain and already capture the real, stable
    developer identity (proven: this checkout's ``user.name``/``user.email``
    resolve to a real name + email, independent of whatever authored HEAD),
    so removing the HEAD-author fallback loses no genuine detection here --
    it only removes a signal that was never "the current account" in the
