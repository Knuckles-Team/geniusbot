I found a solution - the problem arises since the built in Tcl can't find the Thread package. I am linking the Tcl package thread2.8.4 to this comment. Extract the zip file and drag and drop the folder thread2.8.4 to C:\YourPythonInstallationDir\tcl\tcl8.6

Download package here: thread2.8.4.zip

This isn't the best solution in my opinion but is the only one as of now :\
